# 🤔 What is a Dynamic Array? 
A dynamic array, also called as a resizeable array, is a data structure that is manipulable which you can expand and shrink its size. Unlike a static array, which has a fixed length, a dynamic array can adjust its capacity at runtime.

## 🖥️ Language Equivalents
- Java : ArrayList
- C++ : std::Vectors
- Python : list
- JavaScript : Array
- C# : List<T>

# 🗃️ Project Overview
In this repository, I made my own dynamic array using **Java** from scratch. The goal is to better understand how dynamic array works, especially in terms of memory handling, resizing, and better performance. 

## 🎯 Features
- insert() - adds element to the array
- remove() - remove element to the array
- get() - retrieve an element by index
- set() - update the element at a specific index
- capacity() - view current capacity
- size() - view current size
- resize() - automatically resize the capacity 
- clear() - remove all elements
- contains() - check if specific value exists
- indexOf() - get the index of specific value
- reverse() - reverse the element of the array
- toString() - converts the array to a readable string format

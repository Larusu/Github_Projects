## 🤔 What is a Dynamic Array? 
A dynamic array, also called as a resizeable array, is a data structure that is manipulable which you can expand and shrink its size. Unlike a static array, which has a fixed length, a dynamic array can adjust its capacity at runtime.

# 🗃️ Project Overview
In this repository, I made my own dynamic array using **Java** from scratch. The goal is to better understand how dynamic array works, especially in terms of memory handling, resizing, and better performance. 

## Scope
- insert()
- remove()
- get()
- set()
- capacity()
- size()
- resize()
- clear()
- contains()
- indexOf()
- reverse()
- toString()
